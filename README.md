## シーイング (Shīingu)
Shingu is photo sorting program that sorts by hue, saturation or lumination into 2d array
just like in [ImageSorter](https://visual-computing.com/projects/imagesorter) that sorts photos in infinity scrolling 2d array

it will calculate dominate main color of photo, then as dict we will use result of array of colors
similiar to opencv's "hello world"
